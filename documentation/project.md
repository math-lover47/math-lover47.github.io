Create a visually appealing, functional, and responsive website for Kazakhstan’s first digital  
rehabilitation center, integrating CSS Grid and Flexbox, Bootstrap, and UI/UX design  
principles. The website must effectively communicate the center’s mission, values, and  
services while catering to the specific needs of the target audience.

## [UI/UX Principles](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/ui-design-principles/#what-are-ui-design-principles):
Following UI design best practices makes digital products easier for everyone to use, follow, and enjoy. The benefits of applying UI design principles are many, including:

-   **Enhances usability.** UI design principles help you set up signs users can follow towards their goals and make their user experience better —one click, scroll, or interaction at a time.”
 
-   **Improves decision-making.** UI design give structured framework for predicting user needs and making better design choices.

-   **Increases efficiency.** Aligning UI design principles at the start of projects lifts the cognitive load for designers, streamlining workflows and making product teams more efficient(make website making faster with finished design).

-   **Reduces cognitive load.** A well-designed interface can simplify tasks, reducing the mental effort required to complete user actions. Less cognitive load can help create a more intuitive and enjoyable experience.

### 7 UI design principles to improve product design
#### Principle 1: Hierarchy
Designers use [hierarchy](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-visual-hierarchy/) to help users recognize key information and distinguish them from less important elements at a glance

Play with the following visual cues to guide users to different elements within a user interface:
-   **Font size and weight.** Large and bold fonts stand out and can emphasize important information and buttons.
-   **Contrast.** The strategic use of contrasting colors directs users to key elements.
-   **Spacing.** Thoughtful spacing between elements creates visual interest and shows users how different UI elements are related.

#### Principle 2: Progressive disclosure
UX designers typically use progressive disclosure to guide users through a **multi-step process**, providing the right amount of information to make clear choices at each step.
(Avoid using many features at time you need **balance**)

Consider the UX example of a product onboarding flow, which asks you all about **yourself**: your name, your contact information, your role, and industry, and maybe what interests you in this product.

One thing to watch out for with progressive disclosure is losing users along the way. “Give users a way to **orient themselves**, so they know where they are and how many steps they have to go,” Tom recommends.

#### Principle 3: Consistency

A good interface feels **familiar** from the first click. 

When a button looks and works the same way throughout your product, users **stop thinking about the interface** and focus on their tasks.

Continuity becomes increasingly important as users advance through a flow. “If one UI button is suddenly bigger, users are going to wonder why,” Tom says. “That irregularity adds to users' cognitive load, creating hesitancy and confusion. So you need a **good rationale** when you deviate from established patterns.”

#### Principle 4: Contrast
UI designers use contrast strategically to draw attention to important content or features. Tom explains, "For a critical piece of information, you may introduce a higher, more jarring contrast to command the user's attention.”

**Pro tip:** Use Figma's [selection colors feature](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042553434-View-and-adjust-colors-in-a-mixed-selection) to explore different color schemes. It’s also a great tool to apply consistent colors and contrast across your final designs.

#### Principle 5: Accessibility
UI designers also carefully contrast colors and luminosity to make designs distinctive and more accessible to users with vision impairments. (Vision impairments affect [more than one in four users worldwide](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment).)

Black text on a white background remains standard for printed media, but you can choose different colors using [contrast checkers and plugins](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-for-everyone-with-these-accessibility-focused-plugins/) from Figma's design community.

To ensure your designs are inclusive, be sure to implement what is outlined in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) (WCAG), including:

-   Providing alternative text
-   Using appropriate padding rules
-   Ensuring compatibility with assistive technology
-   Providing proper keyboard navigation
-   Using sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors

[See examples:](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/blog/accessible-website-examples/)

#### Principle 6: Proximity
Things that belong together should stay together. Users naturally perceive UI elements that are close together as related, so this type of visual organization creates a more intuitive user experience and natural [user flow](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/user-flow/).

Take streaming services, for example. Play, fast-forward, and rewind buttons on the same row because they all have something to do with controlling video playback. But you’d never find the quit button in this zone. It lives separately to prevent accidental clicks that could interrupt the viewing experience. 

[See examples:](https://venngage.com/blog/design-principle-proximity/)

#### Principle 7: Alignment
Clean lines make designs feel professional. A strong [grid system](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/web-design-grid-layout-examples/) helps establish order and balance. Consistent alignment improves readability and creates predictability, making it easier for users to navigate your website or app.

## [Wireframe vs. mock-up—what’s the difference?](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/wireframe-vs-mockup/)
Wireframes and mock-ups both support product development, helping design teams create captivating user experiences. But while wireframes focus on a high-level design concept’s basic layout and user flow, mock-ups showcase the visual design of the final product.
